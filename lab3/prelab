1.a) TCCR0B controls how fast the timer counts.  This can be done using
the force output compare bits, or the clock select bits (or both).

b) OCR0A is the value with which the timer is compared.  Depending on the
mode of the timer, an output match can be used as a waveform, or create
and interrupt.

c) TIFR0 is the interrupt flag register.  A bit is set when its interrupt
status occurs, and is cleared when the interrupt is handled.

d) FOC0A is the Force Output Compare bit for the output compare A.  Setting
this bit will cause the microcontrollor to act as if the timer value did
indeed equal OCR0A.

e) CS02:0 are the clock select bits.  These are used to determine how fast
the timer counts.

2. OCR0A is the value with which the timer is compared.  Depending on the
mode of the timer, an output match can be used as a waveform, or create
and interrupt.

3. enum status { idle, running, walking };

4. Draw below a 5-state state diagram for going out on a date.

























5. itoa() converts a number into an ASCII string.  It is the opposite of
atoi().  So, if we write
	int x = atoi( itoa( 5 ) );
                          we should get x = 5.
