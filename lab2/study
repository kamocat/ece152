ECE 152 lab 2 Study questions
Marshal Horn


The documentation isn't very clear on what the difference between the
transmit complete bit and the data register empty bit.  The only
differences I saw were that the UDRE1 bit is set after a reset (meaning
it doesn't have to be initialized), and the TXC1 bit needs to be reset
after every transmit.

Anyways, here's the code I adapted to use the TXC1 bit instead of the
UDRE1 bit.

/** This function needs to write a single byte to the UART. It must check that the UART is ready for a new byte 
and return a 1 if the byte was not sent. 
@param [in] data This is the data byte to be sent.
@return The function returns a 1 or error and 0 on successful completion.*/

char send_byte(unsigned char data){
	signed char error = 1;

	if( UCSR1A & 0b01000000 ) {
		/* Transmit is complete. Clear the flag. */
		USCR1A |= 0b01000000;

		/* Now send new byte */
		UDR1 = data;
		error = 0;
	}
	return error;

}
