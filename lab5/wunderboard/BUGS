This file tells us about the current bugs in the program.
Where important, it also tells us about the past bugs in the program and
what we did to fix them.


Without case logic for catching 0, the integer to ASCII converter doesn't
print 0 (it returns an empty string).  Also, I suspect it doesn't handle
negative numbers very well (-4 % 10 is 6).
In the test for counting up from 0 to 50 and back, the newline isn't printed
for numbers greater than 9.
